I've start to work on these project on february, 20.

Since then, I tried to work around two hours a day. I couldn't work on it on february 25 and 26.

I've chosen to use React to develop the project because I think it is a great technology and wanted to test my knowledge in it.

I prefered to not use Redux or other libraries or framework because I was training to think the "react way."

It was very interesting to model a little game using the principles of React, 
the most difficult was to make the drag and drop works the I think it should be on react withou frameworks.

I expect you to enjoy reviewining my code the same I enjoy to code this project.

Thanks for the oportunity!
